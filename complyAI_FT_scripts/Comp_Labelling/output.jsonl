The following steps will guide us to the answer:\n\n1. Identify the relevant regulation:\n   - The context mentions that the minimum size of the square's sides is specified in the Table mentioned in regulation 5 (4) (c).\n\n2. Locate the Table:\n   - The context provides a Table that specifies the minimum height of numerals and letters based on the area of the principal display panel.\n\n3. Analyze the Table:\n   - The Table provides different minimum heights for numerals and letters based on the area of the principal display panel. However, it does not directly specify the minimum size for the sides of the square.\n\n4. Infer the minimum size:\n   - Since the minimum height of numerals and letters is specified, and the cross inside the square must be legible, we can infer that the minimum size of the square's sides should at least accommodate the minimum height of numerals and letters.\n\n5. Determine the minimum height:\n   - The smallest minimum height specified in the Table is 1 mm for areas up to 200 cm\u00b2.\n\n6. Conclude the minimum size of the square's sides:\n   - To ensure the cross is legible and fits within the square, the minimum size of the square's sides should be at least equal to or greater than the minimum height of numerals and letters, which is 1 mm.\n\nTherefore, the minimum size of the square's sides for the symbol is:\n\n<ANSWER>: 1 mm","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>10 per cent. or more Sorbitol and \nSorbitol syrup  May have laxative effect, cause bloating \nand diarrhea in children; and reduce \ncalcium absorption in post -menopausal \nwomen]  \n(2) Every package containing the following articles of food shall bear the foll owing \ndeclarations on the label  in a rectangular box,  namely, - \nSI.

For example, if something is re-operationalized w.e.f. a future date, it means the action will begin on that future date.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the understanding and common usage of \"w.e.f.,\" it can indeed be used to denote future dates.\n\n<ANSWER>: Yes, \"w.e.f.\" can be used to denote future dates.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>3.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>F.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>[Re-operationalized w.e.f.<\/DOCUMENT>\n<DOCUMENT>[Re-operationalized w.e.f. 1st Jan,2023  vide Direction  File No: STD\/SP -08\/A1.2022\/N -01-Part (1)  \ndated 6th Jan,2023 .] \n \n            Provided that every package of edible oils, interesterified  vegetable \nfat, both hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, edible fats, margarine and fat \nspreads (mixed fat spread and vegetable fat spread) and package of food in which \nfats, oils and fat emulsions is used as an ingredient shall declare the quanti ty of trans \nfat content and saturated fat content on the label.
