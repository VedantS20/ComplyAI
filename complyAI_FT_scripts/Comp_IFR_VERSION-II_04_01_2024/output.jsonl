If there are multiple ranges, consider the average or the most representative value.\n\nFrom the context:\n##begin_quote##\n3.

Both ranges are similar, so we can take the average of the two ranges to get a representative value.\n\n- Average of the first range: (3.20 + 4.10) \/ 2 = 3.65 g\n- Average of the second range: (3.50 + 4.50) \/ 2 = 4.00 g\n\nTaking the average of these two averages to get a single representative value:\n- (3.65 + 4.00) \/ 2 = 3.825 g\n\nTherefore, the total protein present is approximately 3.825 g.\n\n<ANSWER>: 3.825 g","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Parameters  Requirements per \n100 g  Requirements per \n100 kcal  \n1.

Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. **Identify the section related to linoleic acid:** We need to look for the specific entry that mentions linoleic acid.\n\n2. **Extract the range values:** Once the entry is located, identify and extract the numerical range provided.\n\nLet's go through the context step by step:\n\n##begin_quote##\nLinoleic acid, mg\n##end_quote##\n\nThe context mentions linoleic acid but does not directly provide the range values adjacent to it. However, looking at the structure of the context, the range values for other components are provided immediately after their mention.\n\nSince linoleic acid is mentioned without an immediate range, we need to look at the structure and the subsequent values provided:\n\n##begin_quote##\n\u03b1-Linolenic acid, mg(Min)  4.40-6.00 4.80-6.60\n350 .00-1400 .00 385 .00-1540 .00\n##end_quote##\n\nThe values \"350.00-1400.00\" and \"385.00-1540.00\" are listed immediately after \"Linoleic acid, mg,\" suggesting these are the range values for linoleic acid.\n\nTherefore, the range of linoleic acid in mg is 350.00-1400.00 and 385.00-1540.00.\n\n<ANSWER>: The range of linoleic acid in mg is 350.00-1400.00 and 385.00-1540.00.","instruction":"<DOCUMENT>Amino acids (L forms), mg, Min  0.90   \n3.
